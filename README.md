SimpleRouting
=============

implement a link-state routing protocol in Erlang. The linkstate protocol is used in for example OSPF, the most used routing protocol for Internet routers. In this case we will make use of a djikstra routing algorithm. This was a work part of a distributed systems course in KTH
For this assignment we had to fill in the missing blocks of the modules dijkstra, map, itf, hist. The rest was provided directly.
